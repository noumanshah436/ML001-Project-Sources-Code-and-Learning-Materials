# 📘 Linear Regression – Detailed Notes with Examples

---

## 1. 🎯 What is Linear Regression?

### 🟢 **Definition:**

Linear Regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** used to predict a **continuous output variable (Y)** based on one or more **input features (X)** by fitting a **straight line** through the data.

* It belongs to **regression problems** in supervised learning.
* Goal: Learn a function **f(x) = y** that predicts the output from the input.

## 2. 🛠️ Problem Example

**Predicting House Price:**

| Size (sq. ft) | Price (in \$) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1000          | 150,000       |
| 1500          | 200,000       |
| 2000          | 250,000       |

* **Input (X)**: Size of the house.
* **Output (Y)**: Price of the house.
* Goal: Predict price for a given house size using a **linear relationship**.

---

## 3. 📉 Visual Intuition

* You have **scattered data points** on an X-Y plane.
* Fit a **straight line** (called **hypothesis line**) through the data.
* This line allows you to make predictions: For a new X (size), the Y (price) is read from the line.

## 4. 🧮 Hypothesis Function

### **Equation of a Line (Simple Linear Regression):**

$$
h(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
$$

* $\theta_0$: **Bias/Intercept** (where the line crosses Y-axis).
* $\theta_1$: **Weight/Slope** (how much Y changes per unit X).

### **Example:**

Let’s say:

* $\theta_0 = 50,000$, $\theta_1 = 100$

Then:

$$
\text{Price} = 50,000 + 100 \times \text{Size}
$$

For size = 1500 sq. ft:

$$
\text{Price} = 50,000 + 100 \times 1500 = 200,000
$$

## 5. 📊 Multiple Linear Regression

### **When more than one feature (X₁, X₂, ... Xₙ):**

$$
h(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \dots + \theta_n x_n
$$

### **Example: Predict house price based on:**

* Size (X₁)
* Number of rooms (X₂)
* Age of house (X₃)

$$
\text{Price} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \times \text{Size} + \theta_2 \times \text{Rooms} + \theta_3 \times \text{Age}
$$

---

## 6. 🧮 Vectorized Form of Hypothesis

### **Equation:**

$$
h(x) = \theta^T \cdot x
$$

### **Where:**

* $\theta = [\theta_0, \theta_1, ..., \theta_n]^T$
* $x = [1, x_1, ..., x_n]^T$
* Dot product gives the same result as summing individual feature weights.

### **In Python (using NumPy):**

```python
y_hat = np.dot(theta, x)
```

## 7. ⚖️ How to Learn the Best Theta (Model Training)

We need to find the **best $\theta$** values that minimize prediction errors.

---

## 8. 📉 Cost Function (Mean Squared Error - MSE)

### **Purpose:**

* Measures **how good/bad** our predictions are.
* Lower cost = better fit.

### **Formula:**

$$
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
$$

### **Explanation:**

* $m$: Number of training examples.
* $h(x^{(i)})$: Predicted value for i-th example.
* $y^{(i)}$: Actual value.
* Take difference (error), square it, sum over all data, and average.

### **Goal:**

* Minimize $J(\theta)$ → find $\theta$ where error is smallest.

---

## 9. 📏 Residuals & Error Visualization

* **Residual = Predicted - Actual value** for each data point.
* The **cost function** sums squared residuals to measure overall error.

---

## 10. 🔁 Gradient Descent (Brief Intro)

To minimize cost $J(\theta)$, we use **Gradient Descent**:

* Iteratively update $\theta$ using:

$$
\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_j}
$$

* $\alpha$: Learning rate (controls step size).

## 11. ✅ Summary of Linear Regression Steps

1. **Prepare Data**: X and Y.
2. **Choose Hypothesis**: $h(x) = \theta^T x$.
3. **Define Cost Function**: $J(\theta)$.
4. **Minimize Cost**: Use gradient descent to find best $\theta$.
5. **Make Predictions**: Plug new X into $h(x)$.
